# bayesian_parameter_estimation

~Currently in the works for Dummy networks/cells... 

The objective is to implement the SBI/Delfi package distribution with NetPyNE to give a better paramter optimization algorithm

For Outputs:

Red Solid Line = Ground Truth Simulation

Blue Dashed Line = Posterior Sample Simulation
